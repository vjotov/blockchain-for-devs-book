# Public Key Cryptography - Concepts

Before introducing the **asymmetric key encryption** schemes and algorithms, we should first understand the concept of **public key cryptography**.

The **public key cryptography** uses a pair of keys: **public key** + **private key**.

Message encryption and signing is done by the private key

Decrypt / verify by public key
