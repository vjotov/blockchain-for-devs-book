## Order Book

Order book is a list of buy and sell orders, organized by price level. It lists the volume of crypto coins being bid or offered at each price point, or market depth. The order book shows pending orders imbalances, which may provide clues to the price direction in the very short term. For example: a massive imbalance of buy orders compared to sell orders, may indicate for a incoming appreciation of the cryptos due to buying pressure.

The order book is also useful in determination of a potential **support** and **resistance** levels. For example: a large amount of buying orders at a specific price, may indicate a level of support, while a crowding of sell orders near at one price may suggest an area of resistance.

## Margin Trading

Margin trading is using of borrowed funds from a broker to trade a financial asset, which forms the collateral for this loan. This manner of trading gives the trader opportunity to buy this bigger quantity then he is able to do normally.

For example, if you trade with 10% margin this means that you can buy 10 times more quantity, but the price movement will impact your account 10 times harder. Margin Ratio is the ratio between the trader's own funds and the open position (purchased securities) in which the trader has invested. For example, a ratio of 10: 1 means that with a $ 1,000 margin deposited with the broker, the trader can buy securities (open a position) of $ 10,000.  
So, in our example if the price goes hi you will receive the 10-time more profit, but if the price goes against you it will produce ten times more loses. Margin trade is extremely risky, so the brokers insist a collateral called margin. The margin is an amount of money that the holder of a financial instrument must deposit with a counterparty \(most often their broker\) to cover the credit risk the holder poses for the counterparty.

## Arbitrage

The price of one crypto coin can vary significant on the different exchanges. Some traders exploiting price differences between currency pairs and exchanges. They buy cryptos cheaply on one exchange, and then send them to another where it’s more expensive \(due to lack of sellers\).  
Triangular arbitrage is where an intermediate pair allows trader to get a better price than between the two original pairs.  
Arbitrage helps normalize the price across pairs and exchanges. This type of exchange strategies is usually done by bots. Make money from interexchange arbitrage sounds very attractive, but opportunities for arbitrage are short-lived and the differences between the exchanges are very small. So, a lot of capital is needed to make a reasonable profit. And be careful: if you see a big price difference that is lasting for hours, odds are some exchange has crashed and it’s not possible to trade there!
