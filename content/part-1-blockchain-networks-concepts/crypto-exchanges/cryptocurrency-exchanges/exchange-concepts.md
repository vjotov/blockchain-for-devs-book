# Exchange Concept

In this chapter we will learn some of the major concepts you will encounter in the world of **exchanges**. We'll talk about the main types of analytics that traders do to make a trading decision. Also we will learn about concepts like Order Book, Margin Trading etc.

## Stock exchange analysis

Trading on exchanges and taking trading decisions is a very hard, complex and risky job. There are two main types of analysis that help traders make decisions in the ocean of data and information: fundamental and technical analysis.

* Fundamental Analysis

![](/assets/Chapter 1.8. Crypto Trading and Exchang/funtamental-analysis.jpg)

Fundamental analysis is the **cornerstone of investing**. In global scope it takes into account all factors from **real economy** which form the **value** of the analyzed asset. In fact, some would say that you aren't really investing if you aren't performing fundamental analysis.

Many conservative analysts say that crypto coins aren't real assets like gold for example. They think that in crypto coins markets only human's greed and psychology factors drive the prices. This is very superficial opinion. Crypto currencies has real value because they **bring the real benefits**. Many of them \(like Bitcoin\) can **transfer value** on chipper prices than alternatives using fiat. Some blockchains \(like Ethereum\) **offers opportunity** to **running smart contracts** and **DAPPs**. Another coins give access to the **real utilities**. For example, with **LookTrip\`s LOC coins** people can **book hotel room without commissions**.  It brings a unique benefits for the crypto currency possessors. The volumes and intensity of use of this currency has a direct impact on its price.  
Behind the crypto coins stay a **technology** and if somebody wants to use it he must buy coins. The price of cryptos depends on the technology used in their blockchain. So if you want to make long term investments in cryptos the **most important factor** that must be taken into account is the **quality of technology behind the coins**. Many serious crypto investors said: I believe in technology! And this technology is 100% real asset. For example: the development of the **Lighting network** push the price of the Bitcoin higher and this is logical because if you want to use lighting cannels you must lock bitcoins. Never spend your money for projects with good-for-nothing technology! This is money thrown on the wind.  
**Second main factor** influence the prices of crypto coins is **adoption**. As more people and countries adopt the using of cryptos as higher will go the prices of coins. This is a consequence of the laws of demand and supply. All news related to the adoption of cryptos is beneficial to their costs. Conversely, the news that, for example, a country forbids the possession of crypto coins or transactions with them has a negative impact on their prices.

## Technical Analysis

Technical analysts, using statistics gathered from trading activity, such as price movements and volume. This is a method of analyzing financial markets that tries to riddle players' psychology. 

* Mathematical Indicators

First main type of technical analysis is using of **mathematical technical** indicators. Mathematical analysis use a series of mathematical calculations applied on the data taken from the charts. The goal of this is to predict where and in which direction the price will move in the future. The indicators attempts to catch a mathematical relationships between the future and past prices. There are dozens and hundreds of indicators in the toolbox of technical analysts. These indicators can be classified as trendfollowing and oscillators.  
With oscillators the analyzers try to catch the overbought and oversold levels of prices. When the value of the oscillator approaches the upper extreme value, analysts interpret that information to mean that the asset is overbought, and as it approaches the lower extreme, analysts consider the asset to be oversold. Examples of oscillators are MACD, stochastic oscillator, RSI e.t.c.

They are form of interpretation of price and volume charts

* Chart Patterns

The next large group of technical analysis tools are the so-called chart patterns. They are part of the classical technical analysis.  
The technical analysis isn\`t an officially recognized science but the most known authors divided patterns into three groups: trend-confirming \(continuation\),  turning \(reversal\) and bilateral figures.  
The most common continuation chart patterns are Wedge \(Falling or Rising\), Rectangle \(Bullish or Bearish\), Pennant \(Bullish or Bearish\) etc.

The reversed figures includes the following patterns: Double Top or Double Bottom, Head and Shoulders or Inversive Head and Shoulders, Rising Wedge or Falling Wedge etc.

The group of Bilateral Patterns included patterns possibly following into two scenarios depending on the direction of the price break.

* Wave Theory of Elliot

Ralph Nelson Elliott is the father of the Wave Theory, which is commonly called and more accurately described as the Elliott Wave Principle. The Elliott Wave Principle is attempts to find the principles which describing how groups of people behave. It reveals that mass psychology swings from pessimism to optimism and back in a natural sequence, creating specific and measurable patterns. Elliott's pattern consists of "impulsive waves" and "corrective waves." An impulsive wave is composed of five subwaves. It moves in the same direction as the trend of the next larger size. A corrective wave is divided into three subwaves. It moves against the trend of the next larger size.

As the figure below shows, these basic patterns build to form five and three-wave structures of increasingly larger size \(larger "degree," as Elliott said\).

In the above illustration, waves 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 together complete a larger impulsive sequence, labeled wave \(1\). The impulsive structure of wave \(1\) tells us that the movement at the next larger degree of trend is also upward. It also warns us to expect a three-wave correction -- in this case, a downtrend.

That correction, wave \(2\), is followed by waves \(3\), \(4\) and \(5\) to complete an impulsive sequence of the next larger degree, labeled as wave 1. At that point, again, a three-wave correction of the same degree occurs, labeled as wave 2.  
Elliott's highly specific rules keep the number of valid interpretations \(or "alternate counts"\) to a minimum. The analyst usually considers as "preferred" the one that satisfies the largest number of guidelines. The top "alternate" is the one that satisfies the next largest number of guidelines, and so on. Alternates are an essential part of using the Elliott Wave Principle.  
View the Elliott Wave Principle as your road map to the market and your investment idea as a trip. We start the trip with a specific plan in mind, but conditions along the way may force us to alter our course. "Alternate counts" are simply side roads that sometimes end up being the best path.

## Order Book

Order book is a list of buy and sell orders, organized by price level. It lists the volume of crypto coins being bid or offered at each price point, or market depth. The order book shows pending orders imbalances, which may provide clues to the price direction in the very short term. For example: a massive imbalance of buy orders compared to sell orders, may indicate for a incoming appreciation of the cryptos due to buying pressure.

The order book is also useful in determination of a potential support and resistance levels. For example: a large amount of buying orders at a specific price, may indicate a level of support, while a crowding of sell orders near at one price may suggest an area of resistance.

## Margin Trading

Margin trading is using of borrowed funds from a broker to trade a financial asset, which forms the collateral for this loan. This manner of trading gives the trader opportunity to buy this bigger quantity then he is able to do normally.

For example, if you trade with 10% margin this means that you can buy 10 times more quantity, but the price movement will impact your account 10 times harder. Margin Ratio is the ratio between the trader's own funds and the open position \(purchased securities\) in which the trader has invested. For example, a ratio of 10: 1 means that with a $ 1,000 margin deposited with the broker, the trader can buy securities \(open a position\) of $ 10,000.  
So, in our example if the price goes hi you will receive the 10-time more profit, but if the price goes against you it will produce ten times more loses. Margin trade is extremely risky, so the brokers insist a collateral called margin. The margin is an amount of money that the holder of a financial instrument must deposit with a counterparty \(most often their broker\) to cover the credit risk the holder poses for the counterparty.

## Arbitrage

The price of one crypto coin can vary significant on the different exchanges. Some traders exploiting price differences between currency pairs and exchanges. They buy cryptos cheaply on one exchange, and then send them to another where it’s more expensive \(due to lack of sellers\).  
Triangular arbitrage is where an intermediate pair allows trader to get a better price than between the two original pairs.  
Arbitrage helps normalize the price across pairs and exchanges. This type of exchange strategies is usually done by bots. Make money from interexchange arbitrage sounds very attractive, but opportunities for arbitrage are short-lived and the differences between the exchanges are very small. So, a lot of capital is needed to make a reasonable profit. And be careful: if you see a big price difference that is lasting for hours, odds are some exchange has crashed and it’s not possible to trade there!
