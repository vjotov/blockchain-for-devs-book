## Steps to Buy and Trade Bitcoin

If you want to take part in crypto-trading the first thing you need is a cryptocurrency wallet. The type of wallet isn\`t important, it can be hardware wallet or desktop / mobile software wallet.   
Remember: If you hold your coins in crypto-enchange, then the exchange poses the private key, so if something happens with this exchange the clients can forget about their keys and coins.   
Then you can buy Bitcoins / altcoins info wallet e.g. from Coinbase, Bitpanda or directly inside the wallet with ShapeShift.   
Once you have own coins you can make trade with them. First you have to send some amount to an exchange such as Bittrex, Kraken, etc. Then you can trade the coins inside your exchange account. Finally you can transfer back coins into your personal wallet or withdraw money into your bank account.

## Order types

An order is an instruction to buy or sell on the cryptocurrency exchange. These instructions can be simple or complicated, and can be sent to either a broker or directly to the exchange via direct market access with web site or rading app. There are some standard instructions for such orders.

* Market order

Market participants can use a couple types of exchange orders. The first is market order. With it the trader buys or sells at best price currently available.

The final price will be aggregation from prices of quantities available in the order book.  Final price will be weighted average of matched prices. In many exchanges for market orders the traders pay more fees because they consume liquidity. When market players place orders they can be makers \(they place pending orders in the orders book and create liquidity\) or takers \(they place orders matching pending orders from the order book and “consume” liquidity by reducing the number of orders on the book\). Takers pay higher fees then makers \(can be double for example\). Usually the fees depend also from the trade volume.   
For example: This is the Bitfinex trading structure

* Stop-Loss Order

A stop order is an order to buy or sell a crypto coins when their price moves past a particular point.

Traditionally this type of orders is used to limiting the losses or locking in a profit. Once the price crosses the predefined price level, the stop order becomes a market order. Notice that the order will not necessarily be filled at the stop price. In a more volatile or less liquid market the price of execution may be worse or better than the predefined stop price. The stop-loss orders are fundamental part of almost all trading strategies. They protect the traders money but on the other hand, they could increase the risk of getting out of a position too early.   
Classical use of stop orders is for exit from positions but they can be used to open a new position also.   
Different brokers offer a many different variants of stop loss orders.  
For a certain variety of orders once the stop level has been reached, the order is automatically converted to a limit order \(depending on the type of order you specify\). In this sense, a stop order acts as a trigger for the limit order.  
There is an order called trailing stop. On which for example you can set the trailing stop of 20 pips which means if the price goes high, your stop order will be moved up and always will be 20 pips or less.   
The traders can limit the length of time in which a stop order can be outstanding before being canceled.

* Limit Order

A limit order is an order placed with intention to buy or sell crypto coins at a specified limit price or better.

Traditionally is used for taking-profit. A limit order is not a market order, it may not be executed if the price wasn\`t met. Limit orders also allow an investor to limit the length of time an order can be outstanding before being canceled.   
Like in stop orders, validity time of limit orders can be limited. Stop orders can be limited in time.
