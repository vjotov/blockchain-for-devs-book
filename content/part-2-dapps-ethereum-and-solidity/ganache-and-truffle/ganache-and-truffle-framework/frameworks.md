Truffle works with almost every JavaScript framework; you can use **Vue.js, Angular, React** or other front end frameworks. 

### Truffle boxes
Truffle boxes are basic boilerplates that can help you with your project. The boxes contain **Solidity contracts** and libraries, front-end frameworks and more. Boxes can save you a lot of time with the structure of your **dApp**. You can find full list of truffle boxes here https://truffleframework.com/boxes
You have boxes for **React**, **Vue** and many more.

One of the more famous boxes is **Metacoin**. Metacoin is box that represents a simple token; in the box you can find a smart contract `MetaCoin.sol` and two test files `TestMetacoin.sol` and `metacoin.js`. We can install the project with:
```
$ mkdir metacoin
$ cd metacoin
$ truffle unbox metacoin 
```
Output
```

Unbox successful. Sweet!

Commands:

  Compile contracts: truffle compile
  Migrate contracts: truffle migrate
  Test contracts:    truffle test
```

Truffle generated for us project with this structure:
```
+ contracts
  -- ConvertLib.sol
  -- MetaCoin.sol
  -- Migrations.sol
+ migrations
  -- 1_initial_migration.js
  -- 2_deploy_contracts.js
+ test
  -- metacoin.js
  -- TestMetacoin.sol
truffle.js
truffle-config.js
```
Now configure your **truffle.js** file and migrate the contracts.
```
$ truffle test
 TestMetacoin
    √ testInitialBalanceUsingDeployedContract (79ms)
    √ testInitialBalanceWithNewMetaCoin (53ms)

  Contract: MetaCoin
    √ should put 10000 MetaCoin in the first account
    √ should call a function that depends on a linked library (68ms)
    √ should send coin correctly (261ms)


  5 passing (1s)
```
If you want to learn how the tests work or to review a token contract, it's the perfect place to start.
